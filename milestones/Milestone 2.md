## Milestone 2 (26th April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

We came up with the following 3 visualization ideas:
  - **Analyzing Race Strategies via Split Times (Paul)**: Through interactive visualizations, we want to understand and categorize race strategies and tactics by analyzing split times. This will offer viewers a granular understanding of athletes' performance throughout a race, allowing for deeper insights into their strategic approaches. We will go through the strengths and weaknesses of each strategy and the context in which they succeed or fail.
  - **World Map Medal Distribution by Country (Laetitia)**: Using geographical visualization techniques, we want to create a dynamic world map showcasing medal distributions by country. Users will be able to interact with the map, accessing detailed information about each country's medal count upon clicking, thereby providing a comprehensive overview of global athletic achievements. This can be applied with a single focus on gold medals per country or alternatively on total medals per country. We must consider how to handle multiple performances per country (take only the best performance, take top-k performances, take top-k athletes' best performances).
  - **Top k Countries Race Times As A Time-Series Bar Chart (Elisa)**: Through a time-series bar chart, we want to illustrate the chronometric performance trends of the top-k countries across various sporting events. This visualization will offer a chronological perspective, allowing users to discern patterns and fluctuations in athletic performance over time. This can also be applied per gender.
  - **Extra Ideas**: We'd like to generate a video animation of our time-series bar chart over time, this could be an entertaining and informative way to display our findings to our viewers. We could also create a quiz on which racing strategy is optimal given a specific context (how fast we are relative to our competition).
